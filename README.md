## About

This project aims to be a easy reference to all hackathons, meetups and other tech events in the Helsinki area, and will hopefully eventually expand to all of Finland + other countries

## Installation

This project is written in HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The only dependency you will need is the Parcel bundler to run the live server and generate build code.

```
parcel index.html
```
